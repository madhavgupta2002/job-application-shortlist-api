I am frustradingly writing to express my interest in the Marketing Manager role at ABC Company. As a highly skilled and experienced marketing professional, I have been applying since 3 months but none has felt the need to reach me which is very upsetting. I want to work and i am having enough qualifications to work for this company because i feel i know everything
